  - name: "(RU) MS-VARX Model and Its Use to Analyze the Business Cycle of the Belarusian Economy"
    releaseDate: 2020-04-01
    originalUrl: "https://www.nbrb.by/bv/articles/10749.pdf"
    url: "https://www.nbrb.by/bv/articles/10749.pdf"
    summary: >
      The model with Markovian switching of conditions MS-VARX, the mathematical grounding of which
      was proposed by the author earlier, extends the well-known model MS-VAR, allowing for the possibility of use of
      exogenous variables. This article covers its economic verification. The problem of the business cycle analysis and
      forecasting of the growth rates of the real GDP of the Belarusian economy is considered. The developed model is
      based on the cointegration interrelation between the real GDP annual growth rates and the Economic Sentiment
      Index (ESI), which is used as an outstripping economic indicator in the exogenous manner. The advantages of
      the proposed model in forecasting the turning points of the cycle and the growth rates of economic activity are
      determined.

    summary: >
      This paper presents a comparative analysis of the Hodrick-Prescott and Hamilton statistical filters
      with regard to the tasks of extraction of the long-term trend and cycle components of the macroeconomic time series. A
      comparative analysis of the turning points of the real GDP cycles and economic sentiment indicator of the Belarusian
      economy obtained for both of these filters is conducted.
