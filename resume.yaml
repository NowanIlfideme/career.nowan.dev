  summary: |
    "Full stack" data scientist, with a focus on econometric modelling using modern machine learning techniques.
    I can lead projects throughout all stages: requirements discovery, EDA, POC, modelling and experimentation, MVP, optimization, deployment and monitoring. 
    I can work in multiple roles project roles: data scientist, technical leader, software developer, software architect, consultant. I prefer a mix of roles.
    I have also created courses and manage/mentor multiple other data scientists in my unit.
    I am fluent in general and scientific Python (PyData stack, PySpark, Pydantic) and deliver high-quality software.
    My main domain experience is in the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods industries.
